# chessGuesser
check-mate move guesser with limited movements.
In this project the provided python file tries to find the movements that will make the user have victory.
What the user should provide is a txt file containing all the places of chess pieces. This initial state file should have
the team of the user in the first line either white or black.

And in the second file the user should provide what the opponents movements are. In that way the program will see what is coming.
The program will output the initial map of the chess board and the required movements for the user to check-mate. The first move is done by the user
and so on.

you can run the program and give the names of the input files explained above, and see how it works'

The exception handling of this project is low level. So if there is an obvious bug or sth else every help is appriciated.

Thanks :)
